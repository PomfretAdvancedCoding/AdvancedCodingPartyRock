# AdvancedCodingPartyRock
This is the "Party Rock" repository for the Pomfret School Advanced Coding class. 

The goal of this program is to learn about GitHub and its interactions with iOS development through Swift. 

The plan is to have an entry view controller with each students' face on a button. Each button will go to the respective student's "Party Rock" table cell excercise.
